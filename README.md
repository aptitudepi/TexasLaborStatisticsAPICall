# TexasLaborStatisticsAPICall
A script I wrote at 2 in the morning to automate the download of Texas Labor Statistics Supply Reports. 
The example API request in ex.py downloads the reports for all Technical Schools/Universities in Texas. 
Downloads of other data will require looking at API requests through something like DevTools XHR tab.
